            <h2>The Trojan War</h2>
            <div class = "war">
                <p>As stated before, the story of the Trojan War fought between the Greeks and the people of Troy is one of the most widely known themes in Homer's epics. It started when Aphrodite, goddess of love, promised Paris the most beautiful mortal woman in the world. At the time, the most beautiful woman was Helen, queen of Sparta and wife of King Menelaus. When Paris went to visit Menelaus, he kidnapped Helen and took her to Troy. King Menelaus was infuriated and recruited warriors from all over Greece in order to get his wife back and attack Troy. He recruited warriars from all over Greece. One of these warriors was a master strategist named Odysseus. For ten years, there was a war between the Greeks and the Trojans called the Trojan War, but the Greeks were never able to get past the walls of Troy. This is where Odysseus became important. He thought of a plan that could get into the city, which began the <b>TROJAN WAR</b>.</p>
