                <b>Reader 1:</b> It has been ten years since the Trojan war started and Prince Memnon of Ethiopia sent supplies and a large army that gave an advantage to Troy, but the Greek were still fighting. One heroic warrior named Achilles, kills Memnon in a glorious battle, but Achilles gets killed by Paris with the help of Apollo. This was prosperous because he was supposed to be invincible. When Achilles was a child, his mother dipped him into the river Styx which made him invincible, but his mother forgot to dip his heel which caused Achilles to die when Paris shot his heel with the guidance of Apollo. They dragged his body out and gave him an honorable burial, but who was going to take his legendary armor that he fought so many battles with. They had a secret vote on who would get the weapons and armor of Achilles. It was going to be between Odysseus and Ajax. Odysseus won it. This made Ajax mad, so he wanted to attack the Greek soldiers, but Athea made Ajax think that the cattle were the soldiers and he killed them. Ajax realized that he ruined perfectly good cattle and felt like a coward, so he killed himself and didn’t get an honorable burial. The death of Ajax was really bad for the Greeks because it lowered the morale of the soldiers since it was looking bad for the Greeks having two great losses in a row.<br><br>

                <b>Reader 2:</b> Moreover, there was a prophet named Helenus who knew the future and was giving an advantage to Troy, so Odysseus kidnapped helenus. Then, Helenus told the Greeks that Troy would fall if someone fought against the trojan with the bow and arrows of hercules, but they gave it to a prince named Philoctetes. Philoctetes was coming to Troy by ship, but the ship stopped at an island to offer a sacrifice and the prince was bitten by a serpent. They tried to carry him to Troy but he ended up deserting him at a deserted island and they gave him the bow and arrows. They sent Odysseus to get them by trickery and he got them, but rather than leaving the prince at the island, he brought the prince to Troy where a wise healer healed him. The prince went into battle and wounded Paris first and Paris begged to be carried to Oenone nymph that lived on Mt. Ida, but she refused to cure Paris because he deserted her. Even though Paris killed Achilles, he wasn't a great loss to Troy.<br><br>

                <b>Reader 3:</b> Odyseus asked to make a large wooden horse and convinced the chieftains to hide inside the horse as well. The plan was not for the Greeks to go back to the sea, but go instead to a nearby island to not be seen. If the plan didn't work, they could go back home, but the people on the horse would die. One Greek was going to stay behind in the camp and convince the Trojans to take the horse into the city. The Greeks were going into the city. When it started, the Trojans thought the Greeks retreated and went back to Greece. When they checked the Greek camp, they found one person named Sinon and claimed he didn't want to be Greek anymore. Also, said to be chosen to be sacrificed and was able to escape. Trojans believed Sinon’s story and invited him to stay with them. In Sinon’s story, the horse was an offering from Athena. The reason it was so big was to discourage the Trojans from taking it into the city. The Greeks wanted to destroy the wooden horse to make Athena mad. They hoped the Trojans would destroy the horse to make Athena mad. There was someone named Laocoon who doubted the horse and two serpents came from the sea and killed Laocoon. The witnesses of Loacoon’s death thought that he was punished for opposing the entry of the horse so they took the horse into the city. However, Sinon’s story was all a lie.<br><br>

                <b>Reader 4:</b> The Trojans then took the wooden horse into the city and into the temple of athena. They thought the war was over and went back home. The Trojans thought the wooden horse was some kind of peace. At night time, the Greeks came out of the wooden horse, opened the gates, and the Greek army marched into the city and burned it. When the Trojans woke up it was too late. The women and children were taken to slavery. Aphrodites helped Helen and reunited her with King Menalaus. <br><br>

            <b>Ajax:</b> My name is Ajax and unlike Odysseus, I don't need a cowardly plan to run away from any situation. I am a true warrior and I face my troubles head-on.<br>
