        <p>Essential Question:<br>What do mythological stories about gods, heroes, and men of the ancient world teach us about our own lives?<br><br>In the video, we describe numerous different scenarios in the story that teach us many lessons. First of all, we can learn to control our anger and not take it out on someone else. If you do take out your anger on someone else, no one will like you. Another lesson we can learn is to rely on your wits and your physical strength rather than just your physical strength. Some vocabulary is shown below.<br><br> 
            <b>Wretched:</b> in a very unhappy or unfortunate state<br>
            <b>Funeral pyre:</b> a pile of wood on which a corpse is burned as part of a funeral ceremony in some traditions.<br>
            <b>Frenzy:</b> a state or period of uncontrolled excitement or wild behavior.<br>
            <b>Nobly:</b> in a way that shows fine personal qualities or high moral principles; gallantly<br>
            <b>Chieftain:</b> the leader of a people or clan<br><br><br>
